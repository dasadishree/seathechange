                    <p>On September 20th, 2025, SEAA participated in the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society’s (AMSEAS) and Town of Hempstead’s beach-clean up! SEAA learned about the environment, and had such a great experience giving back to the local community. The beach clean-up was hosted at Lido Beach, and SEAA recruited volunteers to come help alongside them.</p>
                    <p>SEAA plans to collaborate with AMSEAS in the future, currently working on a future beach-clean up together, and a trip to their office to see sea turtles in rehabilitation in progress!</p>

                     <p>What is International Coastal Clean-Up Day?</p>
               <p>International coastal cleanup day occurs on every third week of September. It’s internationally recognized for being one of the largest protection events, held on beaches to preserve and clean our beach shores while keeping marine animals out of harm. It is common to collect garbage like cigarette butts, plastic, bottle caps, and balloons.</p>
